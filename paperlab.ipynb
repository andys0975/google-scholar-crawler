'background hypertension is common among patients with alzheimer disease. because this group has been excluded from hypertension trials, evidence regarding safety of treatment is lacking. this secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial assessed whether antihypertensive treatment increases the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension (oh) in patients with alzheimer disease. methods and results four hundred seventy-seven patients with mild-to-moderate alzheimer disease were randomized to the calcium-channel blocker nilvadipine 8\\xa0mg/day or placebo for 78\\xa0weeks. presence of oh (blood pressure drop ≥20/≥10\\xa0mm\\xa0hg after 1 minute of standing) and oh-related adverse events (dizziness, syncope, falls, and fractures) was determined at 7 follow-up visits. mean age of the study population was 72.2±8.2\\xa0years and mean mini-mental state examination score was 20.4±3.8. baseline blood pressure was 137.8±14.0/77.0±8.6\\xa0mm\\xa0hg. grade i hypertension was present in 53.4% (n=255). after 13\\xa0weeks, blood pressure had fallen by -7.8/-3.9\\xa0mm\\xa0hg for nilvadipine and by -0.4/-0.8\\xa0mm\\xa0hg for placebo ( p<0.001). across the 78-week intervention period, there was no difference between groups in the proportion of patients with oh at a study visit (odds ratio [95% ci]=1.1 [0.8-1.5], p=0.62), nor in the proportion of visits where a patient met criteria for oh, corrected for number of visits (7.7±13.8% versus 7.3±11.6%). oh-related adverse events were not more often reported in the intervention group compared with placebo. results were similar for those with baseline hypertension. conclusions this study suggests that initiation of a low dose of antihypertensive treatment does not significantly increase the risk of oh in patients with mild-to-moderate alzheimer disease. clinical trial registration url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov . unique identifier: nct02017340.',\n"," 'authors': 'de Heus Rianne A A, Donders Rogier, Santoso
